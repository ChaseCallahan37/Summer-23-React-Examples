//We can use any javascript code within our typescript code

let favColor = "Blue";
console.log(favColor);

//However, we can also add types to our variables

let firstName: string = "Jeff";
console.log(firstName);

//Main types that you will see within typescript

let age: number;
let student: boolean;
let adddress: string;
let table: HTMLElement;

//This prevents us from accidently assigning wrong data types
//to variables, much like C#

age = 3;
